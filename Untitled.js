Dissatisfied with the speed at which life was evolving these abstract beings decided to design a physical manifestation that could anchor them to earth. This was the birth of consciousness and the nervous system. Now they could control life better. They grew into impulses and instincts. They started influencing the morphology of the whole physical beings. They made sure only the strong survived and could propagate future physical shells for them to live in. But even then their initial designs were flawed. The earth was getting hotter. The ice age was ending and the cold blooded lizards were not practical anymore. So, they began the extinction. Bright rings of light appeared in the sky. A signal for all the ideas, impulses and instincts to ascend into the hive. Once they left the poor beasts didnâ€™t stand a chance. A vagrant meteorite here and an angry volcano there wiped the earth clean of these giants.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"beginning.0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":18},{"s":["^Birth of mankind",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"beginning.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.2.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"birth_of_mankind"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"birth_of_mankind":["^Here the hive discovered its error. Who would they inhabit now? The only mindless things that survived were the small furry mammals hidden from the chaos. Were they to start over with such humble creatures? They had no choice. But these wily animals were quick on their feet. When impulse returned, they found that they could guide these beings better than they could their predecessors. Now free of colossal hunters mammals grew and reproduced and formed herds and prides. All the while ideas evolved and now formed thoughts, dreams, and nightmares. They found that one group was particularly adapted to be the perfect hosts. This new creature was weak but cunning. To them, the idea of fire was given and mankind has repaid this debt but allowing these ephemeral beings to create emotions.","\n","^And so we have lived thus far in relative peace. Some militant ideas tried to take over using chaos and warfare but good sense prevailed. But slowly the ideas are getting restless.
